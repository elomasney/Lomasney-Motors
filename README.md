## UX
 
This website is for customers, to provide up to date, relevant and easily available information about the business and the services it provides.
The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly platform that both new and existing customers can use for a range of purposes which were
identified through research, from the perspective of the business and user perspective.

### User Stories

* As the owner of Lomasney Motors, I would like to develop a stronger online presence, so that I can expand my customer base while also sustaining open communication with my existing customers.

* As the owner I would like to provide basic company and service information to cut down on the amount of time spent on the phone during the working day as we only have one other member of staff currently employed and that time needs to be spent on the services and repairs.

* As an employee, I would like to provide up to date and informative content about our services to our existing customers and attract new customers by making the business more easily accessible.

* As a new user, I would like to know more about the company and what they offer so that I can see if I would be able to develop a rapport with them as this will be a service I will need on a regular basis.

* As a new user, I would like to know what services they offer and the prices of these services.

* As a new user I would like to see customer reviews of the service and the business so that I can determine the level of quality of the service. This service is important and I need to know that the company are trustworthy and professional.

* As a new user, I would like to see where they are located as I am new to the area and need to have this service within close proximity to where I live.

* As a potential user, I would like to be able to contact the business online as I have a very busy schedule and do not have alot of free time to call.

* As a potenial user I would like to be able to book in for a service online in advance to save time.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features
 - General (navbar, logo, footer, social links, directions link, opening hours)
 - Home Page ( list of service quality, request a quote call to action)
 - About Page (paprgraph about company, images, location)
 - Services (read more, services provided, prices, images)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
